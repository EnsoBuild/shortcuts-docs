## What is the Router API?

The Route API is a highly-efficient DeFi aggregation and smart order routing REST API over HTTP. With it, developers can easily tap into optimized routes for DeFi positions and token swaps across various chains.

With a single API integration, unlock a host of DeFi strategies in your application. The Route API finds the optimal execution path across a multitude of DeFi protocols such as liquidity pools, lending platforms, automated market makers, yield optimizers, and more.

This allows for maximized capital efficiency and yield optimization, taking into account return rates, gas costs, and slippage. The Route API is your key to navigating the intricate DeFi landscape with ease and efficiency.

Try it out:

Let's say you want to go from Ether to a the steCrv Curve pool. Also, you want to deposit the Curve LP into the Curve Gauge.
In the route endpoint you would simply pass a tokenIn (Ether), the amount and the tokenOut (the Curve Gauge).

Enso will take care to swap your token in to the required token (if needed), deposit the LP into the Curve Gauge and stake the LP tokens into the Curve Gauge.

```bash copy
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/shortcuts/route?chainId=1&tokenInAmountToApprove=0&tokenInAmountToTransfer=&priceImpact=true&toEoa=true&amountIn=1000000000000000000&slippage=300&tokenIn=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&tokenOut=0x182b723a58739a9c974cfdb385ceadb237453c28' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
