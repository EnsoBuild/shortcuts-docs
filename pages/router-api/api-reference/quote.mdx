## GET /v1/shortcuts/quote

If the EoA doesn't hold enough funds or allowance to execute the transaction, the route endpoint won't be able to calculate the best route.

The quote endpoint is a fast way to get the amount of tokenOut that will be received, without the need of holding the funds or allowance.

### Examples

#### Simple ETH to stETH

Spend Ether from the EOA and get stETH in return.

Specify a tokenIn (ETH), tokenOut (stETH) and either a sellAmount to get a route of 1 ETH for WETH.
The route endpoint will calculate the best route for you, choosing between all the avilable AMM's and protocols (E.g. depositing directly to Lido).

If depositing directly to LIDO is the best route the tx object will contain the data to call the deposit function on the LIDO contract, otherwise it will contain the data to call the best AMM.
