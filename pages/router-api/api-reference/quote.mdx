## GET /v1/shortcuts/quote

If the EOA lacks sufficient funds or allowances to execute a transaction, the route endpoint cannot determine the optimal path.

The `/quote` endpoint provides a quick estimate of the `tokenOut` amount that will be received without requiring the user to hold the funds or set allowances.
