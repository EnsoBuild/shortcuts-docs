## Endpoints

Currently, the Router API has only two simple endpoints:

    - `GET /v1/shortcuts/route` - Get an easy-to-submit bytecode to go from a token to another, including LPs and DeFi positions. Returns a transaction that can be submitted to an Ethereum node.
    - `GET /v1/shortcuts/quote` - Get a quote from one token to another.

## Authentication

Enso authenticates your API requests using your accountâ€™s API keys.
Getting an API key is easy, and you can create as many as you need from the Enso developers [portal](https://www.enso.finance/developers).
