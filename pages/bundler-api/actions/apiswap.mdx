# Deposit

Swap one Basic token to another. It gives the best router among multiple aggregators (0x, 1Inch..)

1. For many cases you can directly use the [route endpoint](./route.md) to enter into a position or to get a token, rather than directly using the swap action. The route endpoint will determine best price and gas router for buying the position token on a secondary market.
2. You need to have the token you want to swap from (tokenIn) in your wallet.

## Example

Using the swap action inside of the [bundle endpoint](../../api-reference/bundle).

```
{
    protocol: "enso",
    args: {
        tokenIn: weth,
        tokenOut: usdc,
        amountIn: wethAmount
        slippage: 300
    },
    action: "apiswap",
},
```

```javascript
tokenIn: 'Address of token to send' // You can define many tokens in by [inToken1, inToken2]
tokenOut: 'Address of token to receive'
amountIn: 'Raw amount to send'
slippage: 'Slippage in basis points. Default value is 300 for 3%'
```

## Endpoints

### GET

### POST [/api/v1/shortcuts/bundle](https://api.enso.finance/api#/shortcuts/BundleController_bundleShortcutTransaction)

The bundle endpoint enables bundling of many actions into one transaction, and for the examples below we will simply do one action of deposit.

Convert from [WETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2) to [USDC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48) assuming the user has WETH in their wallet. More more efficiency it is advised to use the [route endpoint](./route.md) for these types of actions

```bash copy
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1e02632d-6feb-4a75-a157-documentation" \
  --data '[
