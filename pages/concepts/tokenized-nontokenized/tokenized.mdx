# Tokenized

Particular DeFi projects associate your interactions with a token sent to your wallet.  For example, if you lend on Aave you will get your representative loan in the `a` version of your [base token](../tokens/baseTokens.mdx) into `aDAI` for example which is a [DeFi position token](../tokens/defiTokens.mdx).


[base tokens](../tokens/baseTokens.mdx) and [DeFi position tokens](../tokens/defiTokens.mdx) are all tokenized positions available.
