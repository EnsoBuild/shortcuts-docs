# Tokenized

Particular DeFi projects associate your interactions with a token sent to your wallet.  For example, if you lend on Aave you will get your representative loan in the `a` version of your [base token](../tokens/baseTokens.mdx) into `aDAI` for example which is a [DeFi position token](../tokens/defiTokens.mdx).


## Endpoints

You can use the [tokens endpoint](../../metadata-api/api-reference/tokens)
