# Non-Tokenized

Particular DeFi actions do not give you a token associated to your interaction with their protocol. For example, depositing on [liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) does not give you a token representing your cdp, similarly with [aave](https://aave.com/) when you borrow you do not get a tokenized position representing your state.

These stateful interactions are associated with the address whether that is an [EOA Address](../eoa-smart-wallet/eoa.mdx) or [Contract Address](../eoa-smart-wallet/smart-wallet).
