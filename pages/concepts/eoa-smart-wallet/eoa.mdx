# Externally Owned Account(EOA)

Applications that enable EOAs to interact with their platform can utilize Enso for all [Base Tokens](../tokens/baseTokens) and [DeFi Tokens](../tokens/defiTokens).

All interactions that are done from an EOA account will result in the corresponding tokens being sent to the EOA account. For example, if a user swaps 5 tokens, and enters 5 DeFi positions then the EOA will obtain all those tokens.
