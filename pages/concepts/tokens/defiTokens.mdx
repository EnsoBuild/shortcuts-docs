# DeFi Tokens

## Summary

DeFi tokens are tokens that represent a DeFi position. DeFi tokens are obtained by depositing underlying tokens, or other DeFi tokens.

For example, depositing [WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) into [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) you will obtain [yvWETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa258C4606Ca8206D8aA700cE2143D7db854D168c) and start generating yield on this.

## Endpoints

You can use the [tokens endpoint](../../metadata-api/api-reference/tokens), filtering by `defiTokens`
