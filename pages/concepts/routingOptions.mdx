# Routing Strategy Options
Inside of the [route](https://api.enso.finance/api#/shortcuts/RouterController_routeShortcutTransaction) endpoint, there are three options for `routingStrategy`: `ensowallet`, `router` and `delegate`. Each of these options are explained below, and have their own particular usecase.

For approving each type of routing strategy option, you can pass inside of the [approval endpoint](https://api.enso.finance/api#/wallet/WalletController_createApproveTransaction) with the desired routing option.

## Router
`router`: is a single contract, which can be seen as the universal router for all interactions that are [tokenized](./tokenized-nontokenized/tokenized.mdx). 

Address: [0x80EbA3855878739F4710233A8a19d89Bdd2ffB8E](https://blockscan.com/address/0x80EbA3855878739F4710233A8a19d89Bdd2ffB8E)

Recommended usecase:
    1. EOAs 

## Delegate
`delegate`: returns calldata in the form of delegateCalls, which allows [tokenized](./tokenized-nontokenized/tokenized.mdx) and [non-tokenized](./tokenized-nontokenized/nontokenized.mdx).  Enabling all state of the smart account to remaiin in the smart account, and not in the router.

Recommended usecase:
    1. Smart Account 

## Enso Wallet
`ensowallet`: returns calldata for deploying a Enso smart account, and executing all the logic inside of the smart account in the same transaction.  Possible for [tokenized](./tokenized-nontokenized/tokenized.mdx) and [non-tokenized](./tokenized-nontokenized/nontokenized.mdx).

Recommended usecase:
    1. New smart account if you aren't already using another service
