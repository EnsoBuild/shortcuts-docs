# Introduction to Enso

## What is Enso?

Enso is financial infrastructure for developers that wish to develop, embed, or utilize DeFi interactions through their application.  Whether this may be a wallet, smart wallet, exchange, defi interface aggregator, router, or any other application wishing to interact with the decentralized finance ecosystem. Enso provides the **tools to execute** and **fetch all relevant metadata** of DeFi protocols enabling developers to build the next generation of financial applications.

**Key points:**
    1. **Native transaction bundling.**  Enso enables users to execute multiple transactions in one atomic transaction.  For example, if a user wishes to swap 10 tokens, lend, borrow, and provide liquidity to a pool all within one transaction, this is possible with Enso.
    2. **Best route execution.**  Enso will fetch the best route for a given desired path taking into account gas execution costs, slippage, and anticipated amount out.
    3. **Standardization.**  Enso provides a standardization layer for developers to easily integrate DeFi protocols into their application.  This includes standardizing the data format, the transaction format, and the execution format.
    4. **Metadata.** Enso provides all metadata related to a DeFi protocol ranging from APY, balances, logos, urls, and more.


## How does Enso work?

Enso is a fully non-custodial aggregation middlelayer between the users, and Decentralized Exchanges, and DeFi protocols.  

Enso supports both [Externally Owned Account(EOA)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) and [Contract Account(Smart Wallet)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) interactions.

### High-level Architecture

1. An **application** wants to offer to their **users** the ability to swap tokens, lend, borrow, or provide liquidity to a pool. 
2. The **application** will send a request to **Enso** with the desired [actions](../background/actions.mdx) and parameters.
3. **Enso** will fetch the [best route](TODO-add) for the given [actions](../background/actions.mdx) and parameters.
4. **Enso** returns calldata back to the **application**.
5. The **application** will present the calldata to the **user**.
6. The **user** will execute on the calldata.
7. The **user** will obtain all all the result from the [actions](../background/actions.mdx) they have chosen.

An example of a actions being bundled together can be viewed in the [actions](../background/actions.mdx) section.

### Externally Owned Account(EOA) Interactions

Applications that enable EOAs to interact with their platform can utilize Enso for all [Tokenized Interactions](../background/tokenizedVsNonTokenized/tokenized.mdx).




### Smart Wallet Interactions
