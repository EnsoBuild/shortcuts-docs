# Actions

## Summary

Actions are standardized interactions related to contract calls, allowing for quick development integration than requiring to handle each individual function signature for each protocol, you can simply use these actions for interacting which associates the function calls of aprotocol.


## Example of Abstraction

Entering into a position is applicable to many protocols, and each protocol function signatures are different, for example:  
`balancer`:`joinPool`  
`uniswap`:`addLiquidity`  


With Enso API if you wish to join a pool on either `Balancer` or `Uniswap` your can simply use the `deposit` standard.


## Endpoints

### GET [/api/v1/actions](https://api.enso.finance/api#/metadata/ActionsController_findAll)

The actions endpoint returns all actions that are applicable to be used within the Enso API for convenience, however you can still do arbitrary calls if there are standards missing for the actions you'd like to complete which can be [seen here](./here).

Try it out:
```
// Replace API key in the header with your own key from https://www.enso.finance/developers
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/actions' \
   --header 'Api-Token: xxxx'
```

You will receive a response that looks like this:
```json
[
  {
    "inputs": {
      "tokenIn": "Address of token to send",
      "tokenOut": "Address of token to receive",
      "amountIn": "Raw amount to send",
      "primaryAddress": "Address of smart contract to interact with"
    },
    "name": "deposit"
  },
]
```
Which returns the list of actions, and inputs required for each action.
