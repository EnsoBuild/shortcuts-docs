## Endpoints

Currently, the Multichain API has only one simple endpoint:

    - `GET /api/experimental/multichain/shortcut/route` - Get an easy-to-submit bytecode to go from a token to another, including LPs and DeFi positions. Returns a transaction that can be submitted to an Ethereum node.

## Authentication

Enso authenticates your API requests using your accountâ€™s API keys.
Getting an API key is easy, and you can create as many as you need from the Enso developers [portal](https://www.enso.finance/developers).
