  When using a Smart Wallet, there's no need for token approvals!

In this example, we have a smart wallet (e.g. Gnosis Safe, Enso Smart Wallet) that is holding [1 WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), and wants to: 4. Deposit 1 WETH into [Beefy Aura wstETH-ETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0d5f9da3613c047003b77caa31270abe3eda6b0)

### Set Smart-wallet address

If you know your address or you are using another smart wallet such as Safe, you can skip to the next step.

You will need to set the smart wallet address in the `fromAddress` field.
If you are using an Enso Smart Wallet, and don't remember the address you can fetch using the metadata API.

Fetch Enso Smart Wallet address from an EoA:

```bash copy
curl -X GET \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/wallet?chainId=1&fromAddress=<EOA_ADDRESS>"
```

It returns the following:

```json
{
  "address": "0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a", // Enso Smart Wallet Address
  "isDeployed": true
}
```

## Step 2: Execute

### Execute: Fetch the actions

We are using the [Route endpoint](../../router-api/api-reference/overview) as it compares the best execution route for token amount out, and gas execution price. For example, it might be better to purchase yvWETH on a secondary exchange than directly depositing it depending upon the exchange rate of that token on the secondary market.

```bash copy
curl -X GET \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1e02632d-6feb-4a75-a157-documentation" \
  "https://api.enso.finance/api/v1/shortcuts/route?chainId=1&fromAddress=0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a&spender=0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a&receiver=0xD6A4217CF6A3587B4E33e9a59C52BF57469e713a&priceImpact=false&amountIn=1000000000000000000&slippage=300&tokenIn=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&tokenOut=0xe0d5f9da3613c047003b77caa31270abe3eda6b0"
```

The `data` value contains the bundle calldata to be submitted to the user.
